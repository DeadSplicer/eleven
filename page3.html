        <p>
Eric Charles is a student currently studying Art Sudio at the University of Kentucky.
<br><br>
Born in Lexington, KY, in 1994, Eric grew up with an interest in computers and video games, and always considered a path in engineering or video game design.
<br><br>
By the end of his senior year in 2012, Eric had already received 15 college credits from BCTC and was teaching himself how to make 3D animations and video games.
<br><br>
He then transferred to UK where he got more experience in 3D programs in his spare time such as Blender, Rhino, Sculptris, Zbrush, Unreal Engine 4, and Maya, as well as receiving instruction in many Adobe programs, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, LightRoom, AfterEffects, and Premiere.
<br><br>
After he is done with college, Eric plans on finding a job in the city as a generalist for films or video games, where he will work on the entire process of making the film or game.
