          As a self-described digital generalist, I work in a variety of digital arts. This includes 2D and 3D, both as still images and animation, as well as some video. A large portion of my work is used as a sort of experiment in different methods of rendering, animating, camera tracking, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Essentially, most of the work I produce is created with the intent that I learn more about how the program I am using works, and how I can get it to do what I want. Some elements and principles of art that are very important to me in creating an animation include color, form, texture, space, contrast, emphasis, movement, rhythm, and unity. All elements and principles are important to in least one step in the process though.
        </p>

          There is a lot that goes into 3D animation, which varies depending on what style I want to achieve. I start by brainstorming a story to tell, or a point I want to make. I do this by looking at a variety of facets to inspire me; everything from other artists (from any medium), the news, social media, or even music. After I get an idea of what I want, I try to figure out how to show that on camera. This includes not only creating a storyboard and a narrative, but also thinking about the style of how the animation will look.
        </p>
        <p>
          After I get a good sketch of the characters and storyboard, I move to 3D programs to make the character and the scene. I primarily switch between Blender, Sculptris, and Zbrush for this. The scene then needs materials and textures for color. I use both Photoshop and Gimp to make the textures and materials. Sometimes I use photos I have taken, other times I digitally paint the texture I need.
        </p>
        <p>
          After I render the animation sequence, I take it into After Effects and/or Premiere for final post-processing, making transitions, and rendering it as a video file.
        </p>

          David O'Reilly is the most inspirational artist in my life currently. He is the reason that I got interested in animation; his style is so stripped of unnecessary beautification that it appeared very approachable to me, and now I strive to achieve that intentional bare-bones style, while still preserving the emotion and beauty that can be conveyed by an animated story. Most of my work is rather dark, but I like the juxtaposition of dark story with funny references or a cute but creepy character to bring about a laugh or two.
        </p>
        <p>
          My future goals as an artist is to get a job working on a film, movie, show, or game. I would love to work as a generalist in a large production company, either for a video game or movie. Continued work in video games and animation/film will help me immensely with finding a job in the area I want.
